# Script to take results file and insert resulst into original images
#   Adds the following to each file (will append to whatever metadat exists):
#   xmp tags:
#     Publisher=ctc_v0.1 
#     HierarchicalSubject=ctc_species|<classname> # Where <classname> is the labelled 'class' in the results file
#     HierarchicalSubject=ctc_probability|<classname>|<prob> # Where <classname> is the labelled 'class' in the results file, and <prob> is the probability
#   iptc:
#     keywords=ctc_species|<classname> # Where <classname> is the labelled 'class' in the results file
#     keywords=ctc_probability|<classname>|<prob> # Where <classname> is the labelled 'class' in the results file, and <prob> is the probability
#
# Assumes files are locally available (e.g. local disk or usb drive)
